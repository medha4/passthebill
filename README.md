The game is called “How to Pass a Bill” and it follows a piece of legislation avoiding obstacles to achieve a higher score. During the game, the bill continuously moves from left to right across a black-and-white desert landscape, with the player attempting to avoid oncoming obstacles such as gavels and other people talking by jumping or ducking. Pressing space will cause the bill to "leap.” As the game progresses, the speed of play gradually increases until the user hits an obstacle, prompting an instant game over. 

The members will be coding in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, which are beginner-friendly coding languages used to build a website. Those learning how to code will specifically learn how to change the colors of the background of the game and decrease the speed of the game.
